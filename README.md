# Stremio for webOS

Custom Stremio app for LG webOS TVs with working audio track selection.

The official Stremio app has a bug where audio tracks don't match what actually plays — selecting "English" might play Russian. This build fixes that by reading tracks from the TV's native media pipeline instead of the streaming server's metadata.

Built from [Stremio Theater v1.9.2](https://github.com/NoobyGains/stremio-vidaa-tv) with the official Stremio streaming server.

## Prerequisites

1. Install the [webOS ares CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@webosose/ares-cli) — `npm i -g @webosose/ares-cli` (requires Node.js 20 for SSH compatibility)
2. Either enable [Developer Mode](https://webostv.developer.lge.com/develop/getting-started/developer-mode-app) on your TV, or have [Homebrew Channel](https://github.com/webosbrew/webos-homebrew-channel) installed
3. Configure your TV as a device — `ares-setup-device`

> **Note:** Developer Mode expires after 1000 hours and any sideloaded apps will be uninstalled. Rooted TVs with Homebrew Channel do not have this limitation.

## Install via Homebrew Channel

If your TV is rooted with [Homebrew Channel](https://github.com/webosbrew/webos-homebrew-channel):

1. Open Homebrew Channel on your TV
2. Go to settings and add this repository: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kieranbrown/stremio-webos/main/webosbrew/apps.json`
3. Find Stremio in the app list and install

## Install manually

```sh
make deploy
```

This downloads all dependencies, builds the app, packages the IPK, installs it on your TV, and launches it.

Replace the default device name if needed: `make deploy DEVICE=myTV`

### Other commands

```sh
make build     # Download dependencies + build (no install)
make package   # Build + create IPK
make restart   # Close + relaunch on TV
make clean     # Remove build artifacts
```

## Auto-start on input select

On rooted TVs, you can register Stremio as an input source so it appears in the TV's input list and can auto-launch:

```sh
luna-send-pub -n 1 'luna://com.webos.service.eim/addDevice' '{"appId":"io.strem.tv","pigImage":""}'
```

Run this via SSH on the TV.
